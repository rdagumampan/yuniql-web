#### Getting started

Install yuniql CLI with Chocolatey or use alternative ways listed here  [{{< ref "/docs/install-yuniql.md" >}}]({{< ref "/docs/install-yuniql.md" >}})

```shell
choco install yuniql
```

Download samples for Oracle. For samples of other platforms, visit https://github.com/rdagumampan/yuniql/tree/master/samples

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rdagumampan/yuniql.git c:\temp\yuniql
cd c:\temp\yuniql\samples\basic-oracle-sample
```

Deploy a local oracle database container. For guidelines, visit https://medium.com/@firzhan/installing-oracle-12c-as-a-docker-container-44985b29bcae

```shell
docker login -u <dockerhub-user-id> -p <dockerhub-password>
docker run --rm -dit --name oracle12c  -p 1521:1521  store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim
docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                            COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                        PORTS                              NAMES
a8433450faf2   store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim   "/bin/sh -c '/bin/baâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute (healthy)   0.0.0.0:1521->1521/tcp, 5500/tcp   oracle12c
```

Verify connection with your SQL Developer or any oracle client using these connection information

```shell
hostname: localhost
port: 1521
service name: ORCLCDB.localdomain
username: sys
password: Oradoc_db1
```

Prepare your connection string and environment variables. You can also pass this directly as CLI parameters using `--platform oracle`, `-p <your-workspace>` and `-c <your-connection-string>`. For more connection string samples, visit https://www.connectionstrings.com/oracle-data-provider-for-net-odp-net/.

```shell
SETX YUNIQL_PLATFORM "oracle"
SETX YUNIQL_WORKSPACE "c:\temp\yuniql\samples\basic-oracle-sample"
SETX YUNIQL_CONNECTION_STRING "Data Source=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=ORCLCDB.localdomain)));User Id=sys;Password=Oradoc_db1;DBA Privilege=SYSDBA;"
```

Verify connectivity with `yuniql check`. Here `yuniql` probes if your connectiong string works by sending `ping` requests to the server, verifying if the TCP port is open and attempting to connect to the target database.

```shell
yuniql check --debug

Keep trying `yuniql check` after few seconds until the container is ready to accept requests. Enable `--debug` for verbose and richer diagnostic messages.

```shell
yuniql check --debug

Apply migrations with `yuniql run`. Here, `yuniql` discovers the project directory, sorts all versions, creates the target database if it doesn't exist and runs all migration steps in the right order. These includes `.sql` files, directories, subdirectories, and csv files.

```shell
yuniql run -a

WRN   2022-01-08 12:57:22Z   Target platform does not support for full transactional DDL operations. All operations will be executed with transaction mode = statement. When transaction mode is set to statement, each batch of sql statement does not participate in a shared transaction context. In the event of failure, the rollback attempt is limited to the individual batch of statement.

Verify applied migration versions with `yuniql list`

```shell
yuniql list

For platforms not supporting full transactional DDL operations (ex. MySql, Snowflake, CockroachDB), unsuccessful migrations will show the status as Failed and you can look for FailedScriptPath and FailedScriptError in the schema version tracking table.

```

Verify results with your preferred Oracle Client. Here we show the results from Oracle SQL Developer. Open in new window/tab for better visibility.

Erase and clean your database with `yuniql erase`. Here, `yuniql` probes and executes all scripts inside `_erase` directory. Developer needs to handcraft the appropriate cleanup scripts when erasing database.

```shell

All operations will be executed with transaction mode = statement. When transaction mode is set to statement, each batch of sql statement does not participate in a shared transaction context. 
In the event of failure, the rollback attempt is limited to the individual batch of statement.

##### Known Issues and limitations

- Bulk files are converted into multi-value insert and only supports string or varchar data types. If you need to support other data types you may create a script to move data from staging table into your final destination table. As alternative, you may opt out from using bulk files and instead prepare a seed script with values to load.
- While this is tested on a Oracle version that supports multi-tenant architecture, pluggable or container database, it was not specifically tested to make use of such feature during testing. We hope to improve this release further with more feedback for our users. Please send your comments and suggestions by creating an issue ticket.
